Summary:

The analysis aimed to evaluate school performance by examining key metrics such as average math and reading scores, and passing rates for both subjects. To identify trends and insights, the data was grouped and analyzed based on the following criteria:

Spending per Student: Schools were categorized into four spending ranges (<$585, $585-630, $630-645, and $645-680). The performance metrics for each range were calculated to determine the relationship between spending and student success.

School Size: Schools were grouped into three size categories (Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000), and Large (2000-5000)), and the average scores and passing rates for each size were analyzed.

School Type: Schools were categorized as either "Charter" or "District," and performance metrics were compared to assess differences in outcomes based on the type of school.

Across all analyses, the metrics of interest included:

Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
Percentage of Students Passing Math
Percentage of Students Passing Reading
Overall Passing Rate (students passing both math and reading)
The goal was to uncover trends and draw meaningful insights into how factors such as spending, size, and school type impact student performance. This structured approach allowed for clear comparisons and evidence-based conclusions.

Conclusion:

Schools spending <$585 per student achieved the highest overall passing rates (90.37%), while those spending $645-680 had the lowest (53.53%). This indicates that higher spending per student does not always result in better performance.
Charter schools significantly outperformed district schools, with an overall passing rate of 90.43%, compared to 53.67% for district schools. This highlights a potential advantage of smaller class sizes or different teaching strategies.
